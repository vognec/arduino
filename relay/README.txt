This project uses a relay to control an external load, two LEDs in this case. Relays are electrically-controlled mechanical switchs that can handle higher power than the Arduino pins can directly control. The relay is controlled by a transistor to switch on the LEDs. A diode is connected in parallel with the relay coil to protect the transistor from voltage spikes when the relay coil is turned off.
