This is a simple thermostat like arduino project. It implements a TMP36 to measure temperate, a potentiometer for dynamically setting the temperature threshold and an LED that will be turned on when the temperature exceeds the set threshold. 

Hardware:
	Arduino UNO
	TMP36 temperature sensor
	Potentiometer
	LED
