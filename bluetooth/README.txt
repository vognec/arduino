This project controls an LED via a smartphone and bluetooth. It implments the HM-10 BLE module. The HM-10 uses BLE 4.0 to communicate with other devices. The appused here is BluetoothLE. After connecting to the HM-10, I send integer values 1 and 2 to turn the LED on and off.

Hardware:
	Arduino Uno
	LED
	HM-10 module
